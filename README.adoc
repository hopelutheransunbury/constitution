= Hope Evangelical Lutheran Church Missouri Synod

In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, Amen.

== Preamble

Recognizing our unity in Christ and our common practice in the Christian faith; desiring to express our fellowship in worship and work; knowing our spiritual needs; mindful of our Christian privileges and duties, and wishing to observe orderly cooperation, we adopt the following constitution:

== ARTICLE I - NAME AND INCORPORATION

The name of the congregation shall be Hope Evangelical Lutheran Church. The congregation shall be incorporated under the laws of the state of Ohio.

== ARTICLE II - CONFESSION OF FAITH

The congregation accepts all the canonical books of the Old and New Testaments as a whole and in all their parts as the divinely inspired, revealed, and inerrant Word of God and submits to this as the only infallible authority in all matters of faith and life. As brief and true statements of the doctrines of the Word of God, the congregation accepts and confesses the following Symbols, subscription to which shall be required of all its members: (1) the ancient ecumenical Creeds the Apostolic, the Nicene, and the Athanasian; (2) the Unaltered Augsburg Confession and Luther's Small Catechism. As further elaboration of and in accord with these Lutheran Symbols, the congregation also receives the other documents in the Book of Concord of 1580: the Apology, Luther's Large Catechism, the Smalcald Articles and the Formula of Concord; and recognizes them as normative for its theology. The congregation accepts without reservation the symbolical books of the evangelical Lutheran Church, not insofar as, but because they are the presentation and explanation of the pure doctrine of the Word of God and a summary of the faith of the evangelical Lutheran Church.

. NOMINATION AND ELECTION PROCESS FOR MEMBERS OF CHURCH COUNCIL +

Members of the congregation will make their nominees, and/or their personal desire to serve, known to the nomination committee. Unless reasons of church discipline prohibit it, the nominating committee will speak with those nominated about the positions and whether they will accept the nomination. The nominating committee will also meet to consider who they would like to nominate for offices and speak with those individuals. The results of the nominating committee will be published at least 2 weeks before the voters meeting. No additional nominations will be considered one week before the voters meeting.
. ELIGIBILITY, SIZE, AND MEETINGS OF THE BOARD OF ELDERS +
+
While either men or women may serve on this board, there are certain duties limited to men (defined in section on DUTIES AND FUNCTIONS OF THE BOARD OF ELDERS) due to how they pertain to the public office of the pastoral ministry. +
+
The nature of the duties of an elder requires that only those noted for their Christian knowledge, zeal, and experience in the spiritual work of Christ shall be elected. To be eligible to be an elder, someone must have served at least one full term on our Church Council and currently be regular in attendance at worship services and a Bible class. +
+
The Board of Elders will all be elected by the congregation and will each serve two year terms. The size of the Board of Elders will reflect the size of the congregation with one elder for up to or a fraction of every 80 baptized members of the congregation roster with a minimum of 3 elders. +
+
A person may serve on the Board of Elders for as many terms as they are elected and desire to serve. However, they can serve as the elder's representative to the Church Council only two consecutive years. +
+
When a vacancy occurs in the Board of Elders, the Church Council will serve as the nomination committee to fill the vacancy. A special voters meeting will elect an elder to serve the completion of the term. There will be at least 3 weeks notice given before this special voters meeting. Nominations may be given to the president of the Church Council up to one week before the special voters meeting. +
+
No additional nominations will be considered one week before the voters meeting. +
+
The elders will meet independent of the Church Council and will annually designate their chair who will serve as a council member. It is possible for an elder to simultaneously hold another position on the Church Council.
. DUTIES AND FUNCTIONS OF THE BOARD OF ELDERS +
+
The Board of Elders does not make final decisions, but will give recommendations and counsel to the Pastor, Church Council, and congregation. The elders shall:
+
.. Encourage and assist the Pastor in his work by word and action. Such assistance would I include prayer for the Pastor, distribution assistance for the Lord's Supper, assisting the Pastor in counseling with difficult cases and in finding peaceful and God pleasing solutions to personal problems within the congregation, and planning with the Pastor, and appropriate committees, items to assist the spiritual health of the congregation.
.. Care for families as assigned them in liaison with the Pastor and Church Council. This care would include prayer for the families, contact when they have missed worship for several weeks, visits when in the hospital, support in times of crisis, whatever kind of visitation may be helpful. Individuals will also be encouraged to initiate contact with an elder if they have a concern, physical need, or spiritual need.

+
In keeping with teachings of the Lutheran Church Missouri Synod, the pastoral office is Scripturally narrowed to men. Therefore, only a man would be allowed to deliver a sermon or lead the worship service. It is also our intent to heed the strong recommendation of the Synod's Commission on Theology and Church Relations when it states: +
"While some might argue that assisting the presiding minister in the distribution of the elements is not necessarily a distinctive function of the pastoral office, the commission strongly recommends that, to avoid confusion regarding the office of the public ministry and to avoid giving offense to the church, such assistance be limited to men" (_Women in the Church,_ Commission on Theology and Church Relations, Lutheran Church Missouri Synod, September 1985, page 47)
. NOMINATIONS AND ELECTION PROCESS FOR BOARD OF ELDERS +
+ 
When elders are to be elected, the Church Council will serve as the nominating committee for the nomination of elders. At a time at least 8 weeks before the May voters meeting, the nominating committee will make known to the congregation the positions which need to be filled. Members of the congregation will make their nominees, and/or their personal desire to serve, known to the nominating committee. Unless the person does not fit the criteria for an elder described above, the nominating committee will speak with the nominee about the position and whether the individual will accept the nomination. The nominating committee will also meet to consider who they would like to nominate for elder and speak with those individuals. The results of the nominating committee will be published at least 2 weeks before the voters meeting. No additional nominations will be considered one week before the voters meeting.

== PART VII - PARISH RECORDS

The records of the congregation shall be and remain the property of the congregation. The pastor shall be responsible for the maintenance of the records, except as otherwise provided herein.
