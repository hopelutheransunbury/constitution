## Risk Assessment

### High-Risk Areas
1. Budget Planning
   - Limited time for forecasting if we don't move the council year to align with the fiscal year.
   - Compressed timeline
   - Christmas / end of year conflicts

2. Leadership Transition
   - Potential confusion during transition
   - Documentation gaps

3. Financial Reporting
   - Transition period complexity
   - Reporting accuracy risks

### Mitigation Strategies
1. Budget Planning
   - Implement rolling forecasts
   - Create preliminary budgets
   - Establish mandatory Q1 reviews

2. Leadership Transition
   - Extended training periods
   - Clear documentation
   - Overlap periods

3. Financial Reporting
   - Enhanced review to ensure we do not miss anything in the intermediate chaos.

### Conditions for Success

1. Timely budget completion
2. Accurate financial reporting
3. Minimal disruption to operations
4. Clear understanding by congregation
5. Successful leadership transitions

## Conclusion
While feasible, this transition presents significant challenges, particularly in budget planning timing. Success requires careful planning, clear communication, and robust monitoring during implementation. The congregation should carefully weigh the benefits against the identified risks and required resources before proceeding.
